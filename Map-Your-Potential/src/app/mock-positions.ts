There are many types of software that a software engineer can develop, such as operating systems, computer games, middleware, business applications and network control systems. Changes in technology and new areas of specialization keeps this profession evolving at a rapid pace. <br><br> When working with a client, a software engineer will typically analyze the client's needs, then design, test, and develop the computer software in order to meet those needs. The process is complicated and intricate, therefore the use of diagrams, flowcharts, and the creation of algorithms to tell the computer what to do are created. Converting these instructions into a computer language (coding or programming) is usually the responsibility of a computer programmer.",
